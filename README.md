# Catan Game Explanation and Assignment Structure

## Game Rules Overview

**Catan**, also known as "The Settlers of Catan," is a popular multiplayer board game where players assume the roles of settlers establishing colonies on the island of Catan. The game revolves around resource management, strategic trading, and building settlements and cities to earn victory points.

### Key Elements of Catan:

1. **Game Setup**:
   - The game board consists of hexagonal tiles representing different terrains (fields, forests, hills, mountains, pastures) and numbers indicating resource production rates.
   - Players start with two settlements and roads on the edges of these tiles.

2. **Turn Sequence**:
   - Players take turns in clockwise order.
   - Each turn begins with rolling two dice to determine resource production. Resources (wood, brick, sheep, wheat, ore) are collected based on the numbers rolled and the player's settlements' positions.
   - Players can trade resources with each other or with the bank to acquire needed materials.

3. **Building and Development**:
   - Players can build roads to connect settlements and cities, expanding their territory.
   - Settlements can be upgraded to cities, which increase resource production.
   - Development cards (e.g., Knight, Monopoly) can be purchased and played to gain advantages or disrupt opponents.

4. **Victory Conditions**:
   - The game ends when a player reaches a specified number of victory points (typically 10 points).
   - Points are earned through building settlements, cities, acquiring specific development cards, and achieving Longest Road or Largest Army milestones.

5. **Trading and Negotiation**:
   - Players negotiate trades of resources with each other, offering mutually beneficial deals or leveraging their resources for strategic advantage.

## Assignment Structure

### 1. **Code Structure Overview**:

- **Main Classes**:
  - **Board**: Manages the game board setup, including tile placement, resource allocation, and dice rolling mechanics.
  - **Player**: Represents each player in the game, tracking resources, settlements, cities, and victory points.
  - **Card**: Abstract base class for game cards with derived classes for specific card types (e.g., Knight, Monopoly).
  - **Catan**: Orchestrates the game flow, handling player interactions, turn sequences, and game-ending conditions.

### 2. **Implementation Details**:

- **Board Initialization**: 
  - Initialize the game board with hexagonal tiles and assign random resource types and production numbers.
  - Set up initial player settlements and roads based on specified rules.

- **Turn Logic**: 
  - Implement the sequence of actions for each player's turn, including dice rolling, resource collection, trading, building, and playing development cards.

- **Victory Conditions**:
  - Monitor players' victory points and declare a winner when a player reaches or exceeds the required points.

- **Resource Management and Trading**:
  - Track resource inventories for each player.
  - Implement trade mechanics allowing players to exchange resources with each other or with the bank.

- **Development Cards**:
  - Implement a deck of development cards that players can purchase and play to influence the game's outcome.

### 3. **Testing and Validation**:

- **Unit Tests**:
  - Develop unit tests to validate the functionality of critical components such as dice rolling, resource allocation, trading logic, and victory conditions.
  - Ensure edge cases and error handling scenarios are covered to maintain robustness and reliability.

### 4. **Extensions and Additional Features (Optional)**:

- **AI Player Implementation**: 
  - Develop AI strategies for computer-controlled opponents to provide single-player gameplay or fill in for missing players.
  
- **Graphical Interface**:
  - Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using SFML or another framework to enhance the game's visual appeal and user interaction.

### 5. **Documentation and README**:

- **README File**:
  - Provide clear instructions on how to compile, run, and play the Catan game.
  - Include an overview of game rules, key features, installation steps, and how to contribute to the project.

- **Code Documentation**:
  - Document code with clear comments and explanations for each class, method, and significant logic block to facilitate understanding and maintenance.
